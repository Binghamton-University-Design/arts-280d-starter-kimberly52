    	<p> Women often feel the need for a makeover. They crave a change that usually begins with their hair. However, dark hair could set a serious limitation if one wants to experiment with different hair colors.
    	</p>
    	<p> But this does not mean you can never experiment. Bleaching your hair can help. In this post, we have discussed how you can bleach your hair right at home. Keep reading. </p>

    	<h1>Preparing Your Hair</h1>
    	
    	<img src="image/bleachprocess.jpg">
    	
    	<p>Bleach works by breaking through your hair shaft and oxidizing the melanin granules that give your hair its color . This process causes hair damage, and for the same reason, your hair needs to be in a healthy condition to be bleached .<p>

    	<p> If your hair is dry or damaged, try waiting a month or two before you bleach it. In the meantime, you can prepare your hair by nursing it back to health. You can start preparing your hair at least two weeks before bleaching it. </p>

    	<h2> 1. Work With Virgin (Or Almost Virgin) Hair </h2>
    	<img src="image/damage.jpg">
    	<p> Hair gets damaged due to chemicals. Bleaching your hair can lead to more damage, as it makes the hair more penetrable. <p>

		<p>Do not process your hair for at least three months prior to the bleaching treatment. If you have processed or colored hair, wait for three months before you decide to bleach it. Bleach works best on virgin and unprocessed hair. Your hair is also more susceptible to damage if you re-process it too soon. <p>

		<h3>3. Condition Like Your Life Depends On It </h3>
		<p> You need to start conditioning your hair two weeks prior to bleaching it. Instead of using store-bought conditioners, opt for deep conditioning masks at least twice a week . </p>

		<p>You can make homemade masks using ingredients like coconut oil, egg, olive oil, bananas, and avocados. Ensure you never wash your hair before oiling it first. This can prevent the shampoo from drying your hair out. </p>

		<H4> Why Should Leave It To The Professionals </h4>

		<p>In the salon, the bleaching process entails a very tedious process. According to colorist Rachel Bodt, the method requires sectioning the hair into very small pieces with a precise brush and mixing bonding treatments (like Olaplex) into the hydrogen peroxide to prevent breakage. These types of treatments aren't sold to customers, just licensed professionals. Once the formula is all mixed, it's applied to those small sections and then the hair is covered in foil or plastic, which will then marinate for 30 to 60 minutes.</p>

<p>That said, bleaching at home is considered ill-advised by professionals. According to Bodt, you should never use any type bleach your own hair at home — even if it's just a root touch-up. "I have heard so many horror stories about clients of mine frying their hair by attempting to just touch up their roots," says Bodt. "Bleach is very strong and can go wrong if you aren't careful. The technique for this service is very meticulous, meaning it requires a lot of attention and detail." </p>

<p>Bodt isn't the only one who has this opinion. New York City-based colorist Aura Friedman, who works with celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Sky Ferreira, also suggests skipping an at-home bleach attempt. "When you bleach your own hair, it's almost impossible to not overlap on already bleached hair, which means you could have a lot of breakages, it's just not worth the risk," says Friedman. </p>


<p>Instead of risking all that damage, she suggests letting it grow. "If you let your hair grow out, allowing it to get healthy and strong, once everything is back to normal, you can go into your salon and allow your colorist to give you the brightest blonde or platinum hair you desire and it will be healthy." </p>

<p> For those who can't wait until they're back in the salon chair, colorist Nikki Ferrara has some advice. Just like Bodt and Friedman, she advises against clients bleaching their own hair — instead, she suggests putting highlights around your face to for the time being. </p>

<p>"If you're fairer-haired — blonde to light brown — I would suggest the DpHUE Blonding Brush. The brush looks like a lush brush and has an easy product to control. It's formulated with lemon juice and peroxide, can lighten gradually, and is designed for face-framing highlights and highlighting the tips of your hair," says Ferrara. The lemon and peroxide in the formula act as lightening agents, according to King. </p>

<p>For darker hair, the Light Works Balayage Kit by Madison Reed is a great option. According to Ferrara, the brush is a wishbone shape that you can dip into the highlighting formula and lightly drag down the surface of your hair, giving it some dimension here and there to blend your roots with the ends of your hair. </p>

<p>Both processes take about 30 minutes and come with everything you need to get the job done. Ferrara suggests purchasing a gloss with both the blonding brush and the balayage kit. "Sometimes you just want a tiny bit of a lift and sometimes it may lift a little too much," she says. "A gloss is there to help with that. Home hair color is always a gamble and until we can all get to our hair colorists, it's always good to have a backup plan. In this case, it's a gloss." We love the Kristin Ess Hair Gloss, it's affordable and makes our hair super shiny, soft, and healthy-looking. </p>

<p>While the sight of overgrown roots may be bothering you, for now, it's better than the damage you may cause by trying your hand at a bleach job. Let it grow, friend. </p>
